# Schedule Generator

How many repositories can I have dedicated to a single project? 4... the original, the app, the executable for presentation, and finally. The C version of it.

This is my attempt to learn C by jumping straight into a project I know I am able to acomplish, but in a language I only know the absolute basics in. Forcing me to get
comfortable in C and learn and understand how it works and how to utilize it.

I don't expect this project to be clean, nice, optimal or any good. This is simply my attempt to recreate an algorithm I wrote in Python in the C programming langauge to
help me learn.
